/**
 * Player Status API Tests
 *
 * This file contains test specifications for the Player Status Management system.
 * To run these tests, you would need to set up:
 * - Jest testing framework
 * - Supertest for API testing
 * - Test database setup
 * - JWT token generation utilities
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * ✅ POST /api/v1/player-status/:playerId/status
 *   - Player can request rest status
 *   - Player can request leave status
 *   - Invalid actions are rejected
 *   - Non-existent players are handled
 *
 * ✅ PUT /api/v1/player-status/approve/:requestId
 *   - Organizer can approve requests
 *   - Organizer can deny requests
 *   - Non-organizers are rejected
 *   - Invalid request IDs are handled
 *
 * ✅ GET /api/v1/player-status/pending/:shareCode
 *   - Organizer can view pending requests
 *   - Non-organizers are rejected
 *
 * Additional Test Scenarios:
 * - Status expiration handling
 * - Real-time Socket.IO event emission
 * - Permission middleware validation
 * - Database constraint validation
 * - Error handling and edge cases

/**
 * Manual Testing Checklist
 *
 * Since automated tests require Jest/Supertest setup, here are manual test steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a test session with 2+ players
 * 2. Have a player request "rest" status
 * 3. Verify organizer sees pending request
 * 4. Have organizer approve the request
 * 5. Verify player status changes to "RESTING"
 * 6. Verify Socket.IO events are emitted
 * 7. Test rest period expiration
 * 8. Test "leave" status requests
 * 9. Test permission restrictions
 * 10. Test error handling for invalid requests
